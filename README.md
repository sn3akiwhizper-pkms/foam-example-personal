# Personal FOAM Example

This repository contains an example demonstration of how I am personally using the FOAM VSCode extension for Personal Knowledge Management System (PKMS). As such this will be a very opinionated and probably random/chaotic structure and MAY NOT BE FOR EVERYBODY. It is loosely based around the Zettelkasten and Digital Garden PKMSs with a couple dashes of Mental Palace concepts sprinkled here and there. Going through this process of developing examples of and researching different PKMSs

## Typical Note/Research Process

1. Start a new year planner with the `yearly-planner` template
2. Start a new month planner with the `monthly-planner` template
3. Every week I create a new file to track and save my random thoughts and link collections

If I keep returning to a topic then I will create a [guide](40.guides/) for it and either link to all of the daily/weekly notes with my previous research or I will copy/paste that info into the guide.

## Topics To Expand Upon

- [ ] Discuss typical process further in [[_personal-note-system]]
- [ ] note `type` set in the yaml with the templates is mostly used for coloring nodes in the graph (see settings.json and [[foam-note-types]])
- [ ] review foam templates in .foam/templates: <https://foambubble.github.io/foam/user/features/note-templates#filepath-attribute>
  - use common vscode snippets: <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_variables>
- [ ] discuss snippets added and why
- [ ] TODO Highlighting in [[todo-tree-highlighting]]
- [ ] Finish intro topics
  - [ ] Foam overview
  - [ ] Advanced Foam?
  - [ ] Overall layout
