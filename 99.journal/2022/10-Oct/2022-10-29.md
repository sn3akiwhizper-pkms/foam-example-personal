# 2022-10-29 Daily Notes

- [Random Internet Reading](#random-internet-reading)

## Random Internet Reading

- suppose I am reading up on a new #PKMS system that I am not familiar with
- I'll use my `article_notes` snippet to save notes about an internet article I find interesting, utilizing the `Expand URL to Markdown` plugin for the article name field #extension
- article: [Use VS Code snippets to generate Markdown front matter](https://dev.to/ceceliacreates/use-vs-code-snippets-to-generate-markdown-front-matter-fpc)
  - tldr; detailed instructions how to generate markdown front matter
  - notes
    - snippet generator app: <https://snippet-generator.app/> #resource
    - tabstops are very useful!
    - dont forget to use [[foam-variables]]
- Then if I feel the collection of information about a topic spans too many daily notes or reaches critical mass, then I'll move it to its own atomic file stored in whatever folder I think is appropriate like [[digital-gardens]]
  - easily search for previous notes using foam tags like #digital-garden
